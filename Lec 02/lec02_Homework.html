    <p><b>Quotation used here : </b>In 1927 Parker started to have more output in the realm of short fiction.<br> While in 1926 she saw five short stories published, the following year,<br> four came out. One, <q>Arrangement in Black and White</q>is a classic, and appeared in <br>The New Yorker in October. A piercing look at racial prejudice of the era, many believe the central character is based <br>on Parker friend, Paul Robeson. These are the stories that will enter the public domain on January 1, 2023, <br>along with where the stories first appeared in print.
